# NSFontAssetRequest_test

 This application is kind of like FontBook.app on macOS.  It lists all fonts on the google server.   I am thinking about integrating this functionality into the font panel, but for now it will remain separate.

## Proposed improvements

* Grey out fonts that are already installed
* Preload the fonts instead of loading them manually.
